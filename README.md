# My Attempt on the LLM project

In my freshie year I faced numerous difficulties regarding how insti and its policies work so my go to guide used to be either the UG rulebook or my seniors.
But of course since the rulebook is a huge document going through it used to be very time consuming and annoying , therefore using the concepts I learnt about LLM through the bootcamp I attempted to solve this issue and tried to make the process much more efficient and quick.

#### About my code -

I mainly used the streamlit library to setup the webpage that is setting up the Page title and what appears to the end user.
I also changed the order of functions such that "Made by Streamlit" isn't visible.
